Mac::iPod::GNUpod
=============================
v. 0.1

ABOUT

This module allows you to manipulate the databases and files on your iPod. It
is a re-implementation of the GNUpod package for manipulating an iPod. This
module provides methods for initializing your iPod, adding and removing songs,
and reading and writing databases in the iTunes and GNUpod formats. This module
is based on the GNUpod script package, written and distributed by Adrian
Ulrich, (pab at blinkenlights.ch). URL: L<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnupod/>.

This module is currently only available for Unix and Unix-like systems, which
probably includes GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, MacOSX and above, and Solaris. YMMV.

DEPENDENCIES

The following perl modules are required:

MP3::Info
MP4::Info
XML::Parser
Unicode::String
File::Copy
File::Spec::Mac
Audio::Wav

No other external programs are needed.

INSTALLATION

Recommended: use the CPAN shell (part of the standard CPAN module) or another
perl package manager.

Otherwise: At the shell type:
    perl ./Makefile.pl
    make
    make test
    make install

As a last resort, you can simply unzip and untar the package yourself and put
the files where you'd like them.
